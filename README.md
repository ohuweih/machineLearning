# machineLearning
Python Machine Learning code for learning how ML works and hopefully get something with ML to work and to work well

# Image Generation
python3 createImage.py

This will take in a dataset of images and try to generate a like image. It has a generator that rates itself on how well it creates the image, a discriminator that rates itself on how well it determans whether an image is AI generated or not. A GAN (Generative adversarial network) which takes the generate and discriminator and runs them against each other


#Image Discription
python3 feedImage.py

This will take an image and return 3 things it thinks it can see in the image. This works as is but its not very good. It seems this is only as good as the dataset you feed it for its training/comperaion.
